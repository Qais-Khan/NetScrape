# Web_Scraper
A web scraper tested on the hacker news website to collect articles with over 100 votes and sort them to display the highest voted articles along with links and vote count

scrape.py needs to be run, which requires you to install the BeautifulSoup and requests modules

pip install beautifulsoup4

pip install requests


Running the script will then work as intended. It will ask how many pages of hacker news to scrape and then it will display a sorted dictionary of results
